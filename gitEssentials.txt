#  When you mess up the remote origin like setting up ssh intead of https for remote
#  and having troubles pushing your code, you need to reset the remote origin.
#  Here is the command that works.

The original mistake was to use ssh endpoint instead of https:
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:yourlogin/yourrepo.git

This would typically result in below error while pushing the repo.

$ git push -u origin main
The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.112.4)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,140.82.112.4' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.


The solution for that is to remove the remote origin and reset it to https.
Below commands should work now.

$ git remote remove origin
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/yourlogin/yourrepo.git
$ git push -u origin main
